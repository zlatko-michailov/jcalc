# jcalc
Minimal and extensible spreadsheet application based on JavaScript.

## History
This was a hackathon project, and it served its purpose - 
it proved the concept that it is possible to build a simple yet powerful calc engine based on JavaScrpt.

## Future
Turning this idea into a useful product requires a more strategic approach.
I've decided to start over. 
Please look at my __[calc.js](../calc.js)__ repo for my lest work on the subject.
